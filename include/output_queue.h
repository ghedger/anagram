// OutputQueue
// This class buffers the console output to a single thread.  This helps prevent
// unwanted output artifacts such as missed carriage returns from text sent to
// stdout from mulitple threads.  Simply disabling buffering or setting line mode
// with setbuf(stdout, NULL) or setlinebuf(stdout) is insufficient.
//
// It implements a fixed circular buffer of fixed item size for storing text
// data designated for stdout.
//
// OutputQueue starts its own worker thread to service the queue at regular
// polled intervals.
//
// It is designed for a pure producer-consumer model in that threads adding
// strings for output should not also remove them; they are to be removed only
// by the worker thread.
// It is scope-coincident, with the thread being terminated
// when the function goes out of scope.
